the United States that have occurred since 1920. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[1][2] Only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of mass shootings can be found per year at their respective pages.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time,[3] with the FBI having a minimum of three. The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as \"public mass shootings\", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.[2] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.[4][5] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a looser definition than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.[6]\nLarger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the Stanford University Mass Shootings in America Data Project.[4][7]\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\nThere are varying definitions of a mass shooting. Listed roughly from most broad to most restrictive:\n\nStanford MSA Data Project: three or more persons shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time. Excluded are shootings associated with organized crime, gangs or drug wars.[7]\nMass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.[6]\nGun Violence Archive/Vox: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.[3]\nMother Jones: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[8]\nThe Washington Post: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[4]\nCongressional Research Service: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings, acts carried out that were inspired by criminal profit, and terrorism.[2]\n\n\nList of mass shootings (21st century)[edit]\n\n\n2023[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For a more comprehensive list, see List of mass shootings in the United States in 2023.\n.mw-parser-output .hover-highlight tr:hover td,.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable tr:hover td{background-color:#eaf3ff}.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable{background:#fff}\n\n\nDate\n\nLocation\n\nDead\n\nInjured\n\nTotal\n\nDescription\n\n\nJuly 2,  2023\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\n2\n\n28\n\n30\n\n2023 Baltimore shooting: Two people were killed and 28 people were injured in South Baltimore.\n\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nDuPage County, Illinois\n\n1\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2023 DuPage County shooting: One person was killed and twenty-two others wounded during a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in unincorporated DuPage County south of Willowbrook, Illinois.[9]\n\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n0\n\n10[n 1]\n\n10\n\n2023 Denver shooting: Ten people were shot in Downtown Denver after the Denver Nuggets won the NBA Championship.[10]\n\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\n2\n\n17[n 2]\n\n19\n\n2023 Richmond shooting: 13 were injured, three critically, at Monroe Park during a graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School.[11]\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFarmington, New Mexico\n\n4[n 1]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n2023 Farmington, New Mexico shooting: Three civilians were killed and at least six others, including two police officers, were injured after an 18 year old man opened fire in the city of Farmington, New Mexico.

Most notable mass shootings in the contiguous United States\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in Alaska\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in Hawaii\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in Puerto Rico\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the United States Virgin Islands\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the Northern Mariana Islands\nThis is a list of the most notable mass shootings in the United States that have occurred since 1920. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[1][2] Only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of mass shootings can be found per year at their respective pages.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time,[3] with the FBI having a minimum of three. The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as \"public mass shootings\", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.[2] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.[4][5] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a looser definition than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.[6]\nLarger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the Stanford University Mass Shootings in America Data Project.[4][7]\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\nThere are varying definitions of a mass shooting. Listed roughly from most broad to most restrictive:\n\nStanford MSA Data Project: three or more persons shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time. Excluded are shootings associated with organized crime, gangs or drug wars.[7]\nMass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.[6]\nGun Violence Archive/Vox: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.[3]\nMother Jones: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[8]\nThe Washington Post: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[4]\nCongressional Research Service: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings, acts carried out that were inspired by criminal profit, and terrorism.[2]\n\n\nList of mass shootings (21st century)[edit]\n\n\n2023[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For a more comprehensive list, see List of mass shootings in the United States in 2023.\n.mw-parser-output .hover-highlight tr:hover td,.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable tr:hover td{background-color:#eaf3ff}.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable{background:#fff}\n\n\nDate\n\nLocation\n\nDead\n\nInjured\n\nTotal\n\nDescription\n\n\nJuly 2,  2023\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\n2\n\n28\n\n30\n\n2023 Baltimore shooting: Two people were killed and 28 people were injured in South Baltimore.\n\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nDuPage County, Illinois\n\n1\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2023 DuPage County shooting: One person was killed and twenty-two others wounded during a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in unincorporated DuPage County south of Willowbrook, Illinois.[9]\n\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n0\n\n10[n 1]\n\n10\n\n2023 Denver shooting: Ten people were shot in Downtown Denver after the Denver Nuggets won the NBA Championship.[10]\n\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\n2\n\n17[n 2]\n\n19\n\n2023 Richmond shooting: 13 were injured, three critically, at Monroe Park during a graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School.[11]\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFarmington, New Mexico\n\n4[n 1]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n2023 Farmington, New Mexico shooting: Three civilians were killed and at least six others, including two police officers, were injured after an 18 year old man opened fire in the city of Farmington, New Mexico.

Rico\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the United States Virgin Islands\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the Northern Mariana Islands\nThis is a list of the most notable mass shootings in the United States that have occurred since 1920. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[1][2] Only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of mass shootings can be found per year at their respective pages.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time,[3] with the FBI having a minimum of three. The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as \"public mass shootings\", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.[2] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.[4][5] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a looser definition than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.[6]\nLarger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the Stanford University Mass Shootings in America Data Project.[4][7]\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\nThere are varying definitions of a mass shooting. Listed roughly from most broad to most restrictive:\n\nStanford MSA Data Project: three or more persons shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time. Excluded are shootings associated with organized crime, gangs or drug wars.[7]\nMass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.[6]\nGun Violence Archive/Vox: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.[3]\nMother Jones: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[8]\nThe Washington Post: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[4]\nCongressional Research Service: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings, acts carried out that were inspired by criminal profit, and terrorism.[2]\n\n\nList of mass shootings (21st century)[edit]\n\n\n2023[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For a more comprehensive list, see List of mass shootings in the United States in 2023.\n.mw-parser-output .hover-highlight tr:hover td,.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable tr:hover td{background-color:#eaf3ff}.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable{background:#fff}\n\n\nDate\n\nLocation\n\nDead\n\nInjured\n\nTotal\n\nDescription\n\n\nJuly 2,  2023\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\n2\n\n28\n\n30\n\n2023 Baltimore shooting: Two people were killed and 28 people were injured in South Baltimore.\n\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nDuPage County, Illinois\n\n1\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2023 DuPage County shooting: One person was killed and twenty-two others wounded during a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in unincorporated DuPage County south of Willowbrook, Illinois.[9]\n\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n0\n\n10[n 1]\n\n10\n\n2023 Denver shooting: Ten people were shot in Downtown Denver after the Denver Nuggets won the NBA Championship.[10]\n\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\n2\n\n17[n 2]\n\n19\n\n2023 Richmond shooting: 13 were injured, three critically, at Monroe Park during a graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School.[11]\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFarmington, New Mexico\n\n4[n 1]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n2023 Farmington, New Mexico shooting: Three civilians were killed and at least six others, including two police officers, were injured after an 18 year old man opened fire in the city of Farmington, New Mexico.

the United States that have occurred since 1920. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[1][2] Only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of mass shootings can be found per year at their respective pages.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time,[3] with the FBI having a minimum of three. The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as \"public mass shootings\", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.[2] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.[4][5] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a looser definition than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.[6]\nLarger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the Stanford University Mass Shootings in America Data Project.[4][7]\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\nThere are varying definitions of a mass shooting. Listed roughly from most broad to most restrictive:\n\nStanford MSA Data Project: three or more persons shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time. Excluded are shootings associated with organized crime, gangs or drug wars.[7]\nMass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.[6]\nGun Violence Archive/Vox: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.[3]\nMother Jones: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[8]\nThe Washington Post: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[4]\nCongressional Research Service: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings, acts carried out that were inspired by criminal profit, and terrorism.[2]\n\n\nList of mass shootings (21st century)[edit]\n\n\n2023[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For a more comprehensive list, see List of mass shootings in the United States in 2023.\n.mw-parser-output .hover-highlight tr:hover td,.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable tr:hover td{background-color:#eaf3ff}.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable{background:#fff}\n\n\nDate\n\nLocation\n\nDead\n\nInjured\n\nTotal\n\nDescription\n\n\nJuly 2,  2023\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\n2\n\n28\n\n30\n\n2023 Baltimore shooting: Two people were killed and 28 people were injured in South Baltimore.\n\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nDuPage County, Illinois\n\n1\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2023 DuPage County shooting: One person was killed and twenty-two others wounded during a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in unincorporated DuPage County south of Willowbrook, Illinois.[9]\n\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n0\n\n10[n 1]\n\n10\n\n2023 Denver shooting: Ten people were shot in Downtown Denver after the Denver Nuggets won the NBA Championship.[10]\n\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\n2\n\n17[n 2]\n\n19\n\n2023 Richmond shooting: 13 were injured, three critically, at Monroe Park during a graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School.[11]\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFarmington, New Mexico\n\n4[n 1]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n2023 Farmington, New Mexico shooting: Three civilians were killed and at least six others, including two police officers, were injured after an 18 year old man opened fire in the city of Farmington, New Mexico.

States Virgin Islands\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the Northern Mariana Islands\nThis is a list of the most notable mass shootings in the United States that have occurred since 1920. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[1][2] Only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of mass shootings can be found per year at their respective pages.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time,[3] with the FBI having a minimum of three. The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as \"public mass shootings\", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.[2] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.[4][5] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a looser definition than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.[6]\nLarger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the Stanford University Mass Shootings in America Data Project.[4][7]\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\nThere are varying definitions of a mass shooting. Listed roughly from most broad to most restrictive:\n\nStanford MSA Data Project: three or more persons shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time. Excluded are shootings associated with organized crime, gangs or drug wars.[7]\nMass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.[6]\nGun Violence Archive/Vox: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.[3]\nMother Jones: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[8]\nThe Washington Post: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[4]\nCongressional Research Service: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings, acts carried out that were inspired by criminal profit, and terrorism.[2]\n\n\nList of mass shootings (21st century)[edit]\n\n\n2023[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For a more comprehensive list, see List of mass shootings in the United States in 2023.\n.mw-parser-output .hover-highlight tr:hover td,.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable tr:hover td{background-color:#eaf3ff}.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable{background:#fff}\n\n\nDate\n\nLocation\n\nDead\n\nInjured\n\nTotal\n\nDescription\n\n\nJuly 2,  2023\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\n2\n\n28\n\n30\n\n2023 Baltimore shooting: Two people were killed and 28 people were injured in South Baltimore.\n\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nDuPage County, Illinois\n\n1\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2023 DuPage County shooting: One person was killed and twenty-two others wounded during a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in unincorporated DuPage County south of Willowbrook, Illinois.[9]\n\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n0\n\n10[n 1]\n\n10\n\n2023 Denver shooting: Ten people were shot in Downtown Denver after the Denver Nuggets won the NBA Championship.[10]\n\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\n2\n\n17[n 2]\n\n19\n\n2023 Richmond shooting: 13 were injured, three critically, at Monroe Park during a graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School.[11]\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFarmington, New Mexico\n\n4[n 1]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n2023 Farmington, New Mexico shooting: Three civilians were killed and at least six others, including two police officers, were injured after an 18 year old man opened fire in the city of Farmington, New Mexico.

Rico\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the United States Virgin Islands\nclass=notpageimage| Mass shootings in the Northern Mariana Islands\nThis is a list of the most notable mass shootings in the United States that have occurred since 1920. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[1][2] Only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of mass shootings can be found per year at their respective pages.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time,[3] with the FBI having a minimum of three. The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as \"public mass shootings\", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.[2] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.[4][5] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a looser definition than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.[6]\nLarger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the Stanford University Mass Shootings in America Data Project.[4][7]\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\nThere are varying definitions of a mass shooting. Listed roughly from most broad to most restrictive:\n\nStanford MSA Data Project: three or more persons shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time. Excluded are shootings associated with organized crime, gangs or drug wars.[7]\nMass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.[6]\nGun Violence Archive/Vox: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.[3]\nMother Jones: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[8]\nThe Washington Post: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.[4]\nCongressional Research Service: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings, acts carried out that were inspired by criminal profit, and terrorism.[2]\n\n\nList of mass shootings (21st century)[edit]\n\n\n2023[edit]\n.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em}For a more comprehensive list, see List of mass shootings in the United States in 2023.\n.mw-parser-output .hover-highlight tr:hover td,.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable tr:hover td{background-color:#eaf3ff}.mw-parser-output .mw-datatable{background:#fff}\n\n\nDate\n\nLocation\n\nDead\n\nInjured\n\nTotal\n\nDescription\n\n\nJuly 2,  2023\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\n2\n\n28\n\n30\n\n2023 Baltimore shooting: Two people were killed and 28 people were injured in South Baltimore.\n\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nDuPage County, Illinois\n\n1\n\n22\n\n23\n\n2023 DuPage County shooting: One person was killed and twenty-two others wounded during a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in unincorporated DuPage County south of Willowbrook, Illinois.[9]\n\n\nJune 13, 2023\n\nDenver, Colorado\n\n0\n\n10[n 1]\n\n10\n\n2023 Denver shooting: Ten people were shot in Downtown Denver after the Denver Nuggets won the NBA Championship.[10]\n\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nRichmond, Virginia\n\n2\n\n17[n 2]\n\n19\n\n2023 Richmond shooting: 13 were injured, three critically, at Monroe Park during a graduation ceremony for Huguenot High School.[11]\n\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFarmington, New Mexico\n\n4[n 1]\n\n6\n\n10\n\n2023 Farmington, New Mexico shooting: Three civilians were killed and at least six others, including two police officers, were injured after an 18 year old man opened fire in the city of Farmington, New Mexico.
